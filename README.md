# Advanced-Algs-Final-Project

For our final project, we delved into how the PageRank algorithm works.
We created 3 different PageRank implementations and applied them to 3 applications:
twitter social networks, a small section of Google's web graph, and a network
of Wikipedia hyperlinks. More information can be found here.
